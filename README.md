## Project 1: button\_led.py

Use a push to contact switch to turn an LED on or off, but instead of the LED just running when the switch is being held, use code to change the function so that the LED turns on with one push of the switch and turns off with the second.

Uses pins 17 and 19 to detect the switch state, and 18 and 20 to power the LED
